# QuizApp
- This is a simple Quiz App built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with Bootstrap for enhanced styling. The app allows users to take a quiz with shuffled questions and options, provides a 30-second timer for each question, and displays results at the end.

# Files
- index.html: The main HTML file containing the structure of the quiz app.
- style.css: The CSS file with styles for the app.
- quiz.js: The JavaScript file that handles the logic of the quiz.

# How to Use
- Open the index.html file in a web browser.
- Enter your name on the landing page and click the "Start Quiz" button.
- Answer each question within the 30-second timer.
- After completing the quiz, the app will display the quiz results.

# Styling
- The app uses Bootstrap for styling, providing a clean and responsive user interface.
- Bootstrap cards are used to present content, and buttons have Bootstrap classes for consistent styling.

# Quiz Questions
- The quiz questions are defined in the quiz.js file as an array of objects.
- Each question has a question string, an options array containing shuffled answer options, and a correctAnswer string.

# Result Display
- After completing the quiz, the app displays the user's score and provides a summary of each question with the user's chosen answer and the correct answer.
- A "Start Again" button allows the user to refresh the page and take the quiz again.

Note: The app is a basic example and can be extended with additional features and questions as needed.
